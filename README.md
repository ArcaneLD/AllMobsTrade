# AllMobsTrade
AMT plugin for Alextogy (video has been deleted so no link on this one) 

Version : 1.16 +
Date : 26/07/2021 (A bit old, I progressed a lot since that plugin)

- Well this one is quite self-explaining but that's a plugin (that depends on a GUI lib "VillagerGUIApi-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar") that allows you to trade with most mobs in the game like if they were Villagers it was made for a Minecraft video "Minecraft But.." style
